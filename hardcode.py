Farmer John's 3 prize cows, Bessie, Elsie, and Mildred, are always wandering off to the far reaches of the farm! He needs your help herding them    back together.
The main field in the farm is long and skinny -- we can think of it as a number line, on which a cow can occupy any integer location. The 3 cows are currently situated at different integer locations, and Farmer John wants to move them so they occupy three consecutive locations (e.g., positions 6, 7, and 8).

Unfortunately, the cows are rather sleepy, and Farmer John has trouble getting their attention to make them move. At any point in time, he can only make a cow move if she is an "endpoint" (either the minimum or maximum position among all the cows). When he moves a cow, he can instruct her to move to any unoccupied integer location as long as in this new location she is no longer an endpoint. Observe that over time, these types of moves tend to push the cows closer and closer together.
Please determine the minimum and maximum number of moves possible before the cows become grouped in three consecutive locations.
INPUT FORMAT (file herding.in):
The input file contains one line with three space-separated integers, giving the locations of Bessie, Elsie, and Mildred. Each location is an integer in the range 1â€¦109.
OUTPUT FORMAT (file herding.out):
The first line of output should contain the minimum number of moves Farmer John needs to make to group the cows together. The second line of output should contain the maximum number of such moves he could conceivably make before the cows become grouped together.

Farmer John owns 7 dairy cows: Bessie, Elsie, Daisy, Gertie, Annabelle, Maggie, and Henrietta. He milks them every day and keeps detailed records on the amount of milk provided by each cow during each milking session. Not surprisingly, Farmer John highly prizes cows that provide large amounts of milk.
Cows, being lazy creatures, don't necessarily want to be responsible for producing too much milk. If it were up to them, they would each be perfectly content to be the lowest-producing cow in the entire herd. However, they keep hearing Farmer John mentioning the phrase "farm to table" with his human friends, and while they don't quite understand what this means, they have a suspicion that it actually may not be the best idea to be the cow producing the least amount of milk. Instead, they figure it's safer to be in the position of producing the second-smallest amount of milk in the herd. Please help the cows figure out which of them currently occupies this desirable position.

INPUT FORMAT (file notlast.in):
The input file for this task starts with a line containing the integer N (1â‰¤Nâ‰¤100), giving the number of entries in Farmer John's milking log.
Each of the N following lines contains the name of a cow (one of the seven above) followed by a positive integer (at most 100), indicating the amount of milk produced by the cow during one of its milking sessions.

Any cow that does not appear in the log at all is assumed to have produced no milk.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file notlast.out):
On a single line of output, please print the name of the cow that produces the second-smallest amount of milk. More precisely, if M is the minimum total amount of milk produced by any cow, please output the name of the cow whose total production is minimal among all cows that produce more than M units of milk. If several cows tie for this designation, or if no cow has this designation (i.e., if all cows have production equal to M), please output the word "Tie". Don't forget to add a newline character at the end of your line of output. Note that M=0 if one of the seven cows is completely absent from the milking log, since this cow would have produced no milk.
SAMPLE INPUT:

Bessie 1
Maggie 13
Elsie 3
Elsie 4
Henrietta 4
Gertie 12
Daisy 7
Annabelle 10
Bessie 6
Henrietta 5
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
Henrietta
In this example, Bessie, Elsie, and Daisy all tie for the minimum by each producing 7 units of milk. The next-largest production, 9 units, is due to Henrietta.

Bessie the cow has designed what she thinks will be the next big hit videogame: "Angry Cows". The premise, which she believes is completely original, is that the player shoots a cow with a slingshot into a one-dimensional scene consisting of a set of hay bales located at various points on a number line; the cow lands on a hay bale with sufficient force to cause the bale to explode, which in turn might set of a chain reaction that causes additional nearby hay bales to explode. The goal is to use a single cow to start a chain reaction that detonates as many hay bales as possible.
There are N hay bales located at distinct integer positions x1,x2,â€¦,xN on the number line. If a cow is launched onto a hay bale at position x, this hay bale explodes with a "blast radius" of 1, meaning that any other hay bales within 1 unit of distance are also engulfed by the explosion. These neighboring bales then themselves explode (all simultaneously), each with a blast radius of 2, so these explosions may engulf additional yet-unexploded bales up to 2 units of distance away. In the next time step, these bales also explode (all simultaneously) with blast radius 3. In general, at time t a set of hay bales will explode, each with blast radius t. Bales engulfed by these explosions will themselves explode at time t+1 with blast radius t+1, and so on.

Please determine the maximum number of hay bales that can explode if a single cow is launched onto the best possible hay bale to start a chain reaction.

INPUT FORMAT (file angry.in):
The first line of input contains N (1â‰¤Nâ‰¤100). The remaining N lines all contain integers x1â€¦xN (each in the range 0â€¦1,000,000,000).
OUTPUT FORMAT (file angry.out):
Please output the maximum number of hay bales that a single cow can cause to explode.
SAMPLE INPUT:
6
8
5
6
13
3
4
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
5
In this example, launching a cow onto the hay bale at position 5 will cause the bales at positions 4 and 6 to explode, each with blast radius 2. These explosions in turn cause the bales at positions 3 and 8 to explode, each with blast radius 3. However, these final explosions are not strong enough to reach the bale at position 13.

Farmer John has purchased a subscription to Good Hooveskeeping magazine for his cows, so they have plenty of material to read while waiting around in the barn during milking sessions. Unfortunately, the latest issue contains a rather inappropriate article on how to cook the perfect steak, which FJ would rather his cows not see (clearly, the magazine is in need of better editorial oversight).

FJ has taken all of the text from the magazine to create the string S of length at most 10^6 characters. From this, he would like to remove occurrences of a substring T to censor the inappropriate content. To do this, Farmer John finds the _first_ occurrence of T in S and deletes it. He then repeats the process again, deleting the first occurrence of T again, continuing until there are no more occurrences of T in S. Note that the deletion of one occurrence might create a new occurrence of T that didn't exist before. Please help FJ determine the final contents of S after censoring is complete.

INPUT FORMAT: (file censor.in)
The first line will contain S. The second line will contain T. The length of T will be at most that of S, and all characters of S and T will be lower-case alphabet characters (in the range a..z).

OUTPUT FORMAT: (file censor.out)
The string S after all deletions are complete. It is guaranteed that S will not become empty during the deletion process.

Farmer John, in his old age, has unfortunately become increasingly grumpy and paranoid. Forgetting the extent to which bovine diversity helped his farm truly flourish over the years, he has recently decided to build a huge fence around the farm, discouraging cows from neighboring farms from visiting, and completely prohibiting entry from a handful of neighboring farms. The cows are quite upset by this state of affairs, not only since they can no longer visit with their friends, but since it has caused them to cancel participation in the International Milking Olympiad, an event to which they look forward all year.
Neighboring cows that still have the ability to enter Farmer John's property find the process has become more arduous, as they can enter only through a single gate where each cow is subject to intense questioning, often causing the cows to queue up in a long line.
For each of the NN cows visiting the farm, you are told the time she arrives at the gate and the duration of time required for her to answer her entry questions. Only one cow can be undergoing questioning at any given time, so if many cows arrive near the same time, they will likely need to wait in line to be processed one by one. For example, if a cow arrives at time 5 and answers questions for 7 units of time, another cow arriving at time 8 would need to wait until time 12 to start answering questions herself.
Please determine the earliest possible time by which all cows are able to enter the farm.
INPUT FORMAT (file cowqueue.in):
The first line of input contains NN, a positive integer at most 100. Each of the next NN lines describes one cow, giving the time it arrives and the time it requires for questioning; each of these numbers are positive integers at most 1,000,000.
OUTPUT FORMAT (file cowqueue.out):
Please determine the minimum possible time at which all the cows could have completed processing.
SAMPLE INPUT:
3
2 1
8 3
5 7
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
15
Here, first cow arrives at time 2 and is quickly processed. The gate remains briefly idle until the third cow arrives at time 5, and begins processing. The second cow then arrives at time 8 and waits until time 5+7=12 to start answering questions, finishing at time 12+3 = 15.

USACO 2017 JANUARY CONTEST, BRONZE
PROBLEM 1. DON'T BE LAST!
Farmer John owns 7 dairy cows: Bessie, Elsie, Daisy, Gertie, Annabelle, Maggie, and Henrietta. He milks them every day and keeps detailed records on the amount of milk provided by each cow during each milking session. Not surprisingly, Farmer John highly prizes cows that provide large amounts of milk.
Cows, being lazy creatures, don't necessarily want to be responsible for producing too much milk. If it were up to them, they would each be perfectly content to be the lowest-producing cow in the entire herd. However, they keep hearing Farmer John mentioning the phrase "farm to table" with his human friends, and while they don't quite understand what this means, they have a suspicion that it actually may not be the best idea to be the cow producing the least amount of milk. Instead, they figure it's safer to be in the position of producing the second-smallest amount of milk in the herd. Please help the cows figure out which of them currently occupies this desirable position.
INPUT FORMAT (file notlast.in):
The input file for this task starts with a line containing the integer NN (1â‰¤Nâ‰¤1001â‰¤Nâ‰¤100), giving the number of entries in Farmer John's milking log.
Each of the NN following lines contains the name of a cow (one of the seven above) followed by a positive integer (at most 100), indicating the amount of milk produced by the cow during one of its milking sessions.
Any cow that does not appear in the log at all is assumed to have produced no milk.
OUTPUT FORMAT (file notlast.out):
On a single line of output, please print the name of the cow that produces the second-smallest amount of milk. More precisely, if MM is the minimum total amount of milk produced by any cow, please output the name of the cow whose total production is minimal among all cows that produce more than MM units of milk. If several cows tie for this designation, or if no cow has this designation (i.e., if all cows have production equal to MM), please output the word "Tie". Don't forget to add a newline character at the end of your line of output. Note that M=0M=0 if one of the seven cows is completely absent from the milking log, since this cow would have produced no milk.
SAMPLE INPUT:
10
Bessie 1
Maggie 13
Elsie 3
Elsie 4
Henrietta 4
Gertie 12
Daisy 7
Annabelle 10
Bessie 6
Henrietta 5
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
Henrietta
In this example, Bessie, Elsie, and Daisy all tie for the minimum by each producing 7 units of milk. The next-largest production, 9 units, is due to Henrietta.

standard output
There is a white sheet of paper lying on a rectangle table. The sheet is a rectangle with its sides parallel to the sides of the table. If you will take a look from above and assume that the bottom left corner of the table has coordinates (0,0)(0,0), and coordinate axes are left and bottom sides of the table, then the bottom left corner of the white sheet has coordinates (x1,y1)(ï¿½1,ï¿½1), and the top right â€” (x2,y2)(ï¿½2,ï¿½2).
After that two black sheets of paper are placed on the table. Sides of both black sheets are also parallel to the sides of the table. Coordinates of the bottom left corner of the first black sheet are (x3,y3)(ï¿½3,ï¿½3), and the top right â€” (x4,y4)(ï¿½4,ï¿½4). Coordinates of the bottom left corner of the second black sheet are (x5,y5)(ï¿½5,ï¿½5), and the top right â€” (x6,y6)(ï¿½6,ï¿½6).
 Example of three rectangles.
Determine if some part of the white sheet can be seen from the above after the two black sheets are placed. The part of the white sheet can be seen if there is at least one point lying not strictly inside the white sheet and strictly outside of both black sheets.
Input
The first line of the input contains four integers x1,y1,x2,y2ï¿½1,ï¿½1,ï¿½2,ï¿½2 (0â‰¤x1<x2â‰¤106,0â‰¤y1<y2â‰¤106)(0â‰¤ï¿½1<ï¿½2â‰¤106,0â‰¤ï¿½1<ï¿½2â‰¤106) â€” coordinates of the bottom left and the top right corners of the white sheet.
The second line of the input contains four integers x3,y3,x4,y4ï¿½3,ï¿½3,ï¿½4,ï¿½4 (0â‰¤x3<x4â‰¤106,0â‰¤y3<y4â‰¤106)(0â‰¤ï¿½3<ï¿½4â‰¤106,0â‰¤ï¿½3<ï¿½4â‰¤106) â€” coordinates of the bottom left and the top right corners of the first black sheet.
The third line of the input contains four integers x5,y5,x6,y6ï¿½5,ï¿½5,ï¿½6,ï¿½6 (0â‰¤x5<x6â‰¤106,0â‰¤y5<y6â‰¤106)(0â‰¤ï¿½5<ï¿½6â‰¤106,0â‰¤ï¿½5<ï¿½6â‰¤106) â€” coordinates of the bottom left and the top right corners of the second black sheet.
The sides of each sheet of paper are parallel (perpendicular) to the coordinate axes.
Output
If some part of the white sheet can be seen from the above after the two black sheets are placed, print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise print "NO".

PROBLEM 1. PHOTOSHOOT
Return to Problem List
Contest has ended.


  
Log in to allow submissions in analysis mode


       
Farmer John, desperate to win the award for best cow photographer at the county fair, is trying to take the perfect photograph of his Nï¿½ cows (2â‰¤Nâ‰¤2â‹…1052â‰¤ï¿½â‰¤2â‹…105, Nï¿½ even).
Farmer John owns cows of two potential breeds: Guernseys and Holsteins. To make his photo as aesthetic as possible, he wants to line up his cows so that as many Guernseys are in even-numbered positions in the line as possible (the first position in the line is an odd position, the next is an even position, and so on). Due to his lack of strong communication with his cows, the only way he can achieve his goal is by asking even length "prefixes" of his cows to reverse themselves (a prefix consists of the range of cows from the first cow up to the jï¿½th cow for some position jï¿½).
Please count the minimum number of reversals required for Farmer John to achieve his goal.
INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line of input contains the value of Nï¿½.
The second line contains a string of length N,ï¿½, specifying the initial ordering of the cows from left to right. Each 'H' represents a Holstein, while each 'G' represents a Guernsey.
OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output the minimum number of reversals needed on a single line.
SAMPLE INPUT:
14
GGGHGHHGHHHGHG
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1
In this example, it suffices to reverse the prefix consisting of the first six cows.
   GGGHGHHGHHHGHG (Before)
-> HGHGGGHGHHHGHG (After)
Before the reversal, four Guernseys were at even positions. After the reversal, six Guernseys are at even positions. It is impossible for there to be more than six Guernseys at even positions.
SCORING:
â€¢	Test cases 2-6 satisfy Nâ‰¤1000ï¿½â‰¤1000.
â€¢	Test cases 7-11 satisfy no additional constraints.
